% Note that the asterisk (*) should be replaced by the name of

% "...for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Department 
% of Romance Languages (French)" would be appropriate since "French"
% is a distinct curriculum within that department. However, since 
% the idea of departments is looser in Adams School of Dentistry,
% "...for the degree of Master of Science in the Adams School of 
% Dentistry (Endodontics)."  may be more appropriate.
